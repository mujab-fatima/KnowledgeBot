KnowledgeBot: Advancing Chatbot Intelligence with Federated Learning


This repository contains the code and resources for reproducing the results of the paper titled "KnowledgeBot - Advancing Chatbot Intelligence: Federated Learning with LLM Model on Wikipedia Corpus". KnowledgeBot utilizes federated learning to enhance chatbot intelligence, leveraging large language models (LLMs) on a Wikipedia corpus.

Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/mujab-fatima/KnowledgeBot.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd KnowledgeBot
Install required dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have all the necessary tools (such as Docker, if applicable for federated learning setup).

Usage
1. Preprocessing the Wikipedia Corpus
To prepare the dataset for training, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python preprocess.py --input <path_to_wikipedia_data> --output <path_to_processed_data>
2. Training the LLM Model
You can start the training process by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py --data <path_to_processed_data> --epochs <num_epochs> --batch-size <batch_size>
This will train the model using the preprocessed Wikipedia data.

3. Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the model, use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python evaluate.py --model <path_to_trained_model> --eval-data <path_to_eval_data>
4. Federated Learning Setup
If you're implementing federated learning:

bash
Copy
Edit
python federated.py --num-participants <num_participants> --rounds <num_rounds>
This will initiate federated learning across multiple participants and aggregate the models accordingly.

Reproduction of Results
To reproduce the results from our paper, follow these steps:

Ensure dataset consistency: We use a subset of the Wikipedia corpus. Please ensure the data is preprocessed as described in the usage section.

Training Configuration: Use the provided training configuration files (config.yaml or CLI arguments) to ensure the model training setup is identical.

Federated Learning Setup: Follow the steps in the Federated Learning Setup section to simulate the federated training process with multiple participants.

Evaluation Metrics: After training, evaluate the model using the same test data and metrics used in our paper to ensure reproducibility.

Federated Learning Setup
For a federated learning setup, follow these steps:

Set up the Participants: We simulate multiple clients. Make sure each participant runs their local training.

Run Federated Learning:

bash
Copy
Edit
python federated.py --num-participants 5 --rounds 10
This will initiate federated learning with 5 participants over 10 rounds.

Model Training
For training the model, we use [LLM Model Name]. You can configure training parameters like the number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, etc. Ensure to use the same setup mentioned in the paper to match the results.

Evaluation
The evaluation step checks the model's performance on various metrics like accuracy, F1 score, etc. You can modify evaluation parameters in the evaluate.py file to fine-tune the evaluation process.

bash
Copy
Edit
python evaluate.py --model <path_to_trained_model> --eval-data <path_to_eval_data>

Suggestions for Improvement:
Clarify Dependencies: Ensure that the requirements.txt file is up-to-date with all the necessary libraries. Include any specific version numbers required to reproduce results accurately.
Model Architecture: Provide a section explaining the architecture of the model, especially if it’s a custom or hybrid approach.
Example Outputs: Show some examples of the chatbot’s responses or a snapshot of the results for users to understand the output.
Federated Learning Details: Offer further details on how federated learning is set up (number of clients, server aggregation, etc.) for better clarity.
